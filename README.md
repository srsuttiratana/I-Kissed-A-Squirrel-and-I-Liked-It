<b>Pre-Requisites</b><br>
1. Download the Beach City assets at http://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/downloads/<br>
2. Extract the files from the zip file. There should be a folder called 'dev' that all files are placed in. <br>
3. Within Beach City's 'dev' folder, there should be 4 folders. Place whatever is in 'Code', 'Cache' and 'Bin64' in their respective folders within C:\Amazon\Lumberyard\1.1.0.0\dev.<br>
4. There should be one more folder called 'Beach City'. Place this folder under C:\Amazon\Lumberyard\1.1.0.0\dev. <br>
5. Download the Woodland Asset Collection here: http://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/downloads/<br>
6. Extract the files from the zip file.<br>
7. From the zip file, cut the folders within the 'Objects' folder and paste them into       'C:\Amazon\Lumberyard\1.1.0.0\dev\BeachCity\Objects'<br>
8. Place the folders 'Diner' and 'open_world' (which are in this repository under 'Levels') in the path C:\Amazon\Lumberyard\1.1.0.0\dev\BeachCity\Levels.<br> 
9. Open Lumberyard Project Configurator and configure the 'BeachCity' project.<br>

FYI: The objects that I uploaded here on Github for BeachCity didn't seem to work. :( So you have to download the entire BeachCity to get it to work. Sorry! <br>
