# I Kissed a Squirrel and I Liked It
<b>NOTE: Please upload all assets to the shared Google Drive folder! We can upload our scripts here for version control purposes. </b><br><br>
<b>Pre-Requisites</b><br>
1. Download the Legacy Code at http://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/downloads/<br>
2. Download the Beach City assets at http://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/downloads/<br>
3. Extract the files from the zip file. There should be a folder called 'dev' that all files are placed in. <br>
4. Within Beach City's 'dev' folder, there should be 4 folders. Place whatever is in 'Code', 'Cache' and 'Bin64' in their respective folders within C:\Amazon\Lumberyard\1.1.0.0\dev.<br>
5. There should be one more folder called 'Beach City'. Place this folder under C:\Amazon\Lumberyard\1.1.0.0\dev. <br>
6. Download the Woodland Asset Collection here: http://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/downloads/<br>
7. Extract the files from the zip file.<br>
8. From the zip file, cut the folders within the 'Objects' folder and paste them into       'C:\Amazon\Lumberyard\1.1.0.0\dev\GameSDK\Objects'<br>
9. Place the folders 'Diner' and 'Dense Forest World' (which are in the Google Drive) in the path C:\Amazon\Lumberyard\1.1.0.0\dev\GameSDK\Levels.<br> 
10. Open Lumberyard Project Configurator and configure the 'GameSDK' project.<br>

EDIT: If you don't want all the Beach City assets, you only need the following Objects in the Beach City folder: <br>
- BeachCity\Architecture\Diner<br>
- Everything under BeachCity\Props that begins with "Diner_"<br>
- BeachCity\Props\JukeBox<br>

I think that's all the assets you need from Beach City. But if I'm missing one, let me know!<br>
