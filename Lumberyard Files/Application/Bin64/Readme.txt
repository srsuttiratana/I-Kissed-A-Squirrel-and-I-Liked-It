Place 'LumberyardLauncherConfig.json' into:
Lumberyard -> 1.1.0.0 -> dev -> Bin64

Run 'LumberyardLauncherBatch.exe'
Then run the Lumberyard Launcher. 
SFML 2.3.2 should appear in the required SDKs. Follow the instructions so the Lumberyard can find and "install" it.

NOTE: Every time you make a change in the Lumberyard folders (e.g. add a folder) you MUST run 'LumberyardLauncherBatch.exe' or else Lumberyard won't notice
